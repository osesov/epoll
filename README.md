# Electronic Poll via Ethereum Example

This is an example project on how to develop Ethereum smart-contract
and client.

Epoll project implements very simple voting system, with quite a few
of limitations, as opposed to regular voting system.

In particular, epoll demonstrates following properties:

1) Eligibility: weak. Anybody, who has ethereum account, and can
   access this system, can vote.  So voter might be non-relevant in
   general. This might be enforced by network organization, or might
   be addressed n the code itself.
   
2) Anonymity: pretty strong, unless the same account used for other
   purports.

3) Confidentiality: weak. Anybody can see other's choices, however
   there is no link to the person.

4) Vote falsification: strong. It's computationally unfeasible to cast
   a vote under other person's account, due to use state-of-art Public
   key cryptography.

5) Tamper proof: strong. It's computationally unfeasible to change
   data in the storage due to blockchain properties.


# Installation and usage

This scenario runs both ethereum node and client application in
localhost-only truffle debug environment.

ATTENTION: In order to run the demo node.js and npm should be
installed.

Truffle is a framework to write, debug, and test both ethereum
smart-contracts and applications, written in JavaScript.

```bash
### Check out git repository:
$ git clone git@github.com:osesov/epoll.git
$ cd epoll

### Install necessary components
$ npm install

### Run ganache: local ethereum client, used to test ethereum applications. 
$ ./node_modules/.bin/ganache-cli
Ganache CLI v6.3.0 (ganache-core: 2.4.0)

Available Accounts
....
Listening on 127.0.0.1:8545

### In another console, deploy smart contracts truffle
$ cd epoll
$ ./node_modules/.bin/truffle migrate

### and finally run e-vote test:
$ ./node_modules/.bin/truffle test

# Source code

Source code:

- `contracts/epoll.sol`: ethereum smart-contract code, written in
  solidity.

- `test/poll.js`: poll client module, written in JavaScript. This
  module consists of two classes: CA and VOTER.
  
  class `CA` implements Central Authority handling - the service,
  which creates a poll and is responsible for maintaining it.

  Methods provided:
  - startPoll: create a new poll.
  - endPoll: complete a poll, so it could not be voted any more
  - getResults: Read results from the poll.
  
  class `VOTER` implements voter functionality.
  - vote: cast a vote. Vote is accepted if this voter has made no
    choice yet and the casted vote is in a valid range.  All these
    limitations are enforces at blockchain side, in the smart
    contract. Finally vote emits event to the sender with the voting
    outcome (if it was accepted or not).
  - getResults: Read results from the poll.
   
- `test/utils.js`: some Ethereum utils, used in poll client
  implementation.

- `test/epoll.js`: truffle JavaScript test for the epoll
  smart-contract.
